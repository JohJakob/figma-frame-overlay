- Remove custom overlay fills using the “Remove overlay fill” command

- Automatically updates the fill of an existing overlay layer (named “Overlay”) when the plugin is run again
- The overlay will be placed below layers like popovers, alerts, context menus, notifications, and more

> **Note**

> - The overlay will be placed below the first layer on the first level of the selected frame that has one of the following terms in its name: Alert, App Clip, Context Menu, Contextual Menu, Dynamic Island, Face ID, Keyboard, Modal, Notification, Popover, Sheet, Status Bar, and Touch ID
> - In frames with Auto Layout, the overlay will be positioned absolutely
